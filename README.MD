2. **Settings Screen:** 
   - The `SettingsScreen` is described as before, with additional emphasis on saving and applying the settings.

3. **Game Screen:** 
   - The `GameScreen` is also covered in detail, showing how the game operates and how users interact with it.

You can modify the file paths for screenshots or replace them with actual images from your project. Let me know if you need more adjustments!
